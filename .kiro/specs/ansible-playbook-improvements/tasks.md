# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enhance common role with improved package manager detection
  - Modify roles/common/tasks/main.yml to implement robust package manager detection logic
  - Add support for Amazon Linux, Oracle Linux, and other RHEL derivatives
  - Implement fallback detection using binary availability checks
  - Add clear error handling for unsupported distributions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 2. Add network retry logic to all download operations
  - Update all get_url tasks in docker and tailscale roles with retry logic
  - Implement exponential backoff pattern (5s, 10s, 20s delays)
  - Add meaningful error messages for network failures
  - Ensure idempotency is maintained with retry logic
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Implement dynamic Docker Compose version fetching
  - Add task to query GitHub API for latest Docker Compose release
  - Implement fallback mechanism to hardcoded version on API failure
  - Cache API response to avoid repeated calls during playbook execution
  - Update Docker Compose download task to use dynamic version
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 4. Add comprehensive tagging system to all roles
  - Add tags to all tasks in common role (common, validation, backup)
  - Add tags to all tasks in admin_user role (admin, validation, backup)
  - Add tags to all tasks in docker role (docker, validation)
  - Add tags to all tasks in tailscale role (tailscale, validation)
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 5. Create handler files for service management
  - Create roles/common/handlers/main.yml for package cache updates
  - Create roles/admin_user/handlers/main.yml for SSH service restart
  - Create roles/docker/handlers/main.yml for Docker service restart
  - Create roles/tailscale/handlers/main.yml for Tailscale service restart
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 6. Implement backup system for configuration files
  - Add backup tasks before modifying sudoers files in admin_user role
  - Create backup directory structure with appropriate permissions
  - Implement timestamped backup naming convention
  - Add backup cleanup to maintain only last 5 backups per file
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3_

- [x] 7. Add validation tasks for system state verification
  - Add service status validation tasks to docker and tailscale roles
  - Add user authentication and permission validation to admin_user role
  - Add package functionality validation to all roles
  - Implement validation task tagging for selective execution
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [x] 8. Update task notifications to use handlers
  - Modify service installation tasks to notify appropriate handlers
  - Update configuration file modification tasks to trigger service restarts
  - Ensure handlers run only once at the end of play execution
  - Test handler triggering with multiple configuration changes
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 9. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Implement detailed error messages for all failure scenarios
  - Add debug logging for troubleshooting network and package issues
  - Create error recovery suggestions in task failure messages
  - Test error handling with simulated failure conditions
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.2_

- [x] 10. Create integration tests for all improvements
  - Write test cases for package manager detection across distributions
  - Test network retry logic with simulated network failures
  - Validate tag-based execution for all tag combinations
  - Test backup and restore functionality
  - Verify handler execution and service management
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1_
